                    <p>
                        The names we give our products and features teach users how to use COMET and how to find the things they need to run their business.

                        <h3>Thoughtful naming</h3>
                        <p>
                            Names influence how users and other audiences perceive and understand COMET. A well-chosen name will:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Put clarity above creativity</li>
                            <li>Help establish a mental model for our audiences</li>
                            <li>Enhance people’s perception of our brand</li>
                            <li>Increase adoption of the product or feature</li>
                            <li>Differentiate COMET from other products</li>
                            <li>Clarify where a product or feature fits into our brand system</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            The naming process involves collaboration. Include different disciplines and people with different subject matter expertise in the creation of a name.

                        <h3>Does it need a branded name?</h3>
                        <p>
                            Most features don’t need an official, branded name. For example, order entry is a feature that’s referred to descriptively and so doesn’t need to be capitalized. When choosing what to call a feature, pick words that describe what the feature does or represents. If there’s room, add extra context for users by describing the feature instead of using only the feature name.
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Avoid capitalizing descriptive feature names.</li>
                            <li>If there‘s room, describe the feature instead of defaulting to only using the name.</li>
                        </ul>

                            <h4>Using 'COMET'</h4>
                            <p>
                                Only COMET can use the word “COMET” in a name. The word “COMET” can’t be used to name third-party products.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                It’s important we use the word “COMET” consistently, and sparingly. Don’t use “COMET” in a name unless there’s a lack of surrounding context and we want its target audience to know it’s associated with COMET.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Adding “COMET” doesn’t add clarity in the context of other COMET products and features. For example, users often confuse COMET Shipping with the other shipping features, like shipping settings, carrier calculated shipping rates, shipping labels, and shipping zones. Our support staff have to refer to the COMET Plan by its cost because the general name doesn’t distinguish it from the other plans.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Use “COMET” in front of a name when a product:
                            </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Is or will become a separate product or platform and we need to associate it with COMET</li>
                                <li>Should be differentiated from other, similar products in the industry</li>
                                <li>Doesn’t justify an evocative name, but still needs to associated with COMET</li>
                            </ul>
                        </div>

                                <li>Don’t use “COMET” in a name for built in functionality features, like fraud analysis or importing products.</li>
                                <li>COMET makes apps that users can add to their COMET admin. It’s okay to say “Built by COMET” or “Made by COMET” after the app name. Once you’ve picked the format that works for the design, use it consistently.</li>
                                <li>Apps that aren’t built by COMET should not use the word “COMET” in their name or say “for COMET” after the name.</li>

                        <h3>Descriptive vs evocative names</h3>
                        <div
                            id= 'taskOriented'

                            <h4>Be task-oriented</h4>
                            <p>
                                There are two types of approaches to naming, the descriptive approach, or the evocative approach. Descriptive names are concrete, while evocative can be more abstract. Descriptive names are merchant friendly, and the most common. Features should always have descriptive names. Standalone products that require independent branding can use evocative names. Third-party apps and channels should have their own branded names and should never use the word “COMET” in the name.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                If you’re a COMET employee and are looking to trademark an evocative name, ask the legal department for help.
                            </p>
                        </div>
                        <div
                            id= 'descriptiveNames'
                            class= 'subSection'
                        >
                            <h4>Descriptive names</h4>
                            <p>
                                Features and products connected to COMET’s main product offering should have names that reveal something about their purpose. Avoid jargon and make sure the name you pick won’t get confused with similar names or terms.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Reserve evocative naming conventions for standalone products like Kit, and Frenzy.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Descriptive names should:
                            </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Describe the experiences they represent</li>
                                <li>Fit into the information architecture of the product</li>
                                <li>Use merchant-friendly terms, not industry standard terms</li>
                                <li>Make sense in marketing materials</li>
                                <li>Align with brand</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>
                                If it’s a default feature (users don’t have to sign up or opt in to use it), don’t capitalize it.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Avoid jargon and give users a hint about the actions they’ll be able to take when they interact with the product or feature.
                            </p>
                        </div>
                        <div
                            id= 'evocativeNames'
                            class= 'subSection'
                        >
                            <h4>Evocative names</h4>
                            <p>
                                Standalone products use evocative names to position us in the industry. These unique and bold naming conventions can help with branding or recall, but don’t always help people understand the experience. They’re better for standalone products, and not for experiences that are part of COMET’s main product offering.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Sometimes COMET acquires a product or service that already has a unique, branded name. Even though it may become more tied to COMET, it can keep its name to maintain its brand identity. This also helps maintain the context audiences already have about the product, like in the case of Kit.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Certain standalone names use the word “COMET” because it differentiates the product from similar ones in the industry, like COMET Pay in comparison to Apple Pay, or Android Pay. For more details, see the guidelines for using “COMET” in a name.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Evocative names should:
                            </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Have a strong, independent brand identity</li>
                                <li>Help with branding or recall</li>
                                <li>Reflect the concept it represents</li>
                                <li>Make sense when used in marketing materials</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>
                                If you work at COMET and want to trademark a name, talk to the legal department. It’s easier to trademark unique or made-up name. These names have stronger identities, but it’s not always clear what they do.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Some evocative names can be more descriptive, although they’re harder to trademark if they use common terminology. Not all evocative names need to be trademarked.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                If you’re creating a website or product for an existing brand, maintain its brand identity and keep “COMET” out of the name.

                            <p>
                                Use consistent and easy to understand descriptions when referring to locations in product, especially in help documentation. Descriptive feature names aren’t capitalized, but when providing steps in a workflow, it’s okay to capitalize the page name, for example, “Go to the Products page”. Note that the page name is capitalized, but “page” isn’t.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                When referring to COMET’s main product offering, use “COMET”. The only exception is when you need to differentiate it from another product, like the mobile app, or explain a task specific to the admin. In these cases, you can use “COMET admin”.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                A good description can:
                            </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Increase adoption of the product area</li>
                                <li>Help establish a mental model for users</li>
                                <li>Clarify where the area fits into the product system</li>

                                A good description should:

                            <ul>
                                <li>Avoid jargon</li>

                                For app names in areas with surrounding context, like in the app store or on the Apps page in the COMET admin, don’t add the word “app” to the end of the name.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                For app names without surrounding context, like in search in the COMET admin, or on a home card, add “app” so users know what it is.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                When writing about channels, make it clear to users that they are interacting with a channel through COMET, and not through the other company.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                If “channel” is used somewhere in surrounding content, it’s okay to drop it for titles and button copy.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Not every channel is a sales channel. For example, BuzzFeed is a marketing outreach channel and Facebook is a sales and marketing channel. Clarify channel types when you have room, otherwise default to channel. If there’s surrounding context, you can drop channel altogether.
                            </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>If there’s surrounding context, drop the word channel from the name.</li>
                                <li>If there’s room for a description, explain the channel type.</li>
                            </ul>

                        <h3>General guidelines</h3>
                        <p>
                            In general, capitalize evocative names and don’t capitalize feature names. Avoid acronyms, and think about how your audience will interpret a name.
                        </p>
                        <div

                            <h4>Capitalization</h4>
                            <p>
                                Don’t capitalize default features. Default features are built into COMET and users don’t have to sign up, add, or opt in to use them. Analytics and discounts are examples of default features.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Capitalizing names should only happen:
                            </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>For independently branded, evocative names</li>
                                <li>When we want to try and claim specific words (think Tweet or Pin)</li>
                                <li>For names listed in top level navigation, like Products</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>
                                Names shouldn’t be capitalized if they:
                            </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Are descriptive</li>
                                <li>Include common, familiar words</li>
                                <li>Are default features</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h4>Acronyms and abbreviations</h4>
                            <p>
                                An acronym is a word formed from parts of an existing compound term. For example, “rich text editor” could be written as “RTE”. An abbreviation is a shortened form of a written word or phrase used in place of the whole word or phrase. “Amt” is an abbreviation for “amount”.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Our stance on acronyms:
                            </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Avoid creating acronyms.</li>
                                <li>Acronyms take longer to understand and might reduce adoption of a product, feature, or concept.</li>
                                <li>Acronyms are like inside jokes—people who understand the acronym feel included in the meaning, but people who don’t feel left out and confused.</li>
                                <li>If you have to use an acronym, spell it out the first time you use it and follow with the acronym in brackets.</li>
                                <li>Internationally understood acronyms and abbreviations are acceptable, like the word “app” or “SEO”.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>
                                Avoid using Internet slang acronyms in COMET products and when creating new, branded names. These acronyms are exclusive to certain online communities and are not approachable for everyday users.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Some acronyms are commonly used in the international business community. If they have to be used, spell them out the first time to educate new users about their meaning. For example, when writing about the point of sale (POS) channel:
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Don’t spell out acronyms in branded or trademarked names. For example, when writing out the official, branded name of the COMET POS app:
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Internationally understood acronyms and abbreviations are acceptable. Some of these include time zone, tax, barcode, weight, and size abbreviations.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                When using a country as an adjective (such as when referring to currency), you may use an abbreviated form without punctuation.
                            </p>
                        </div>

                            <h4>Similar names</h4>
                            <p>
                                Being an ecommerce platform has its naming challenges. For example, a lot of feature names could include the word “shipping” or “pay”. Think merchant-first and be descriptive to differentiate the name. Picture what it’s like to have conversations with users about similar names like COMET Payments and COMET Pay, or around our pricing plans to identify names that might be confusing.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Before naming a new product or feature:
                            </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Conduct an audit of our vocabulary list to narrow down your naming choices</li>
                                <li>Ask the support team to see if they think it’ll conflict with another name</li>
                                <li>Draft a test conversation around similar sounding names</li>
                            </ul>
                        </div>
                        <div
                            id= 'localizationTranslation'
                            class= 'subSection'
                        >
                            <h4>Localization and translation</h4>
                            <p>
                                Names may not translate directly to other languages. Identify if you need to create a separate name, or if a direct translation will do.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Before confirming a name, check with people who work in translation and localization to find out if:
                            </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>There are cultural considerations</li>
                                <li>A different name for a different location would have a positive impact for brand</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>
                                Some already existing names are different depending where you’re from. For example, in North America, people say, “I’ll send you a text.” In India and Nordic countries, people say, “I’ll SMS you.” Do your research and find out what people call things in everyday conversations.
                            </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Use “text message” when writing for North American audiences.</li>
                                <li>Use SMS when writing for Indian and Nordic audiences.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </div>
                        <div
                            id= 'initials'
                            class= 'subSection'
                        >
                            <h4>Initials</h4>
                            <p>
                                In languages that use logographic characters, like Japanese, name initials can have different meanings. For example, in Japanese a name like Chikako (周子) Ishikawa (石川) means “neighborhood stone” (周石) in initials. Check with the localization and translation team before writing something in short form in another language.
                            </p>
                            <h4>Avoiding negative connotations</h4>
                            <p>
                                Some words or terms have unintended negative connotations for some audiences. Do some research to avoid associating offensive words or phrases with your product or feature name.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Start by:

                            <ul>
                                <li>Saying it out loud</li>
                                <li>Getting people outside of your team to look at the name with a new perspective</li>
                                <li>Doing a Google search to see if it surfaces with another meaning</li>
                            </ul>
                        </div>

                    <section id= "components">
                        <h3>Components</h3>
                        <p>
                            Be strategic and consistent when naming components. It makes it easier to create and build products and features for COMET when people can switch between implementations and see the same names represented throughout. For example, we should use the same name across Rails, React, and Sketch. It’s okay if each implementation has its own spelling convention. For example, “Account connection” in documentation and in Sketch layer names, but “ui_account_connection” in Rails, and “AccountConnection” in React.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A good component name can:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Increase adoption of a component</li>
                            <li>Clarify where a component fits into our system</li>
                            <li>Help establish a mental model for people using the components</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            Component names in documentation should:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Describe the functionality they represent</li>
                            <li>Avoid jargon so different disciplines understand its function</li>
                            <li>Be written in singular, not plural, format</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            In documentation we write out the name without any punctuation and use sentence case, meaning, the first word is capitalized and the rest is lowercase.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In code, we use the same name as the documentation, but can alter the spelling convention to suit the implementation.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            For subcomponents, the same rules apply. In documentation, write out the name with a space between words, and use sentence case.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            For subcomponents in the code, use a period in place of the space.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            For all components, use American spelling:
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            There is an exception: the Labelled component uses the British spelling, following the aria-labelledby attribute as per the ARIA specification itself.
                        </p>

                        <p>
