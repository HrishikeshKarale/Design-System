                    <p>
                        It’s important to use the same words, spelling, and capitalization consistently, otherwise things start looking messy and confusing for merchants.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In general, if a feature or product isn’t unique to us (e.g. blogs, navigation, pages, etc.) don’t capitalize it. If it’s unique to Shopify and marketable as its own “product” (e.g. Shopify Shipping) then capitalize it. Edge cases will be addressed individually and documented here.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Use American English spelling for all merchant-facing content. When in doubt, check the <a href= "https://www.merriam-webster.com/">Merriam-Webster dictionary</a> for the preferred spelling of specific terms not found in this list.

                                Tip: Use “Theme” as the primary term, but use “website template” in descriptions to add context for merchants who don’t know what a theme is yet.
