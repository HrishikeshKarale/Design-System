                            <p>
                                You should (almost) always write in the active voice:
                            </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Subject (person/thing acting) verb (the action) object (receives the action)</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>
                                Use the active voice if users need to do something. It should be clear that the subject is the one doing the action.
                            </p>
                        </div>
                        <div class= 'subSection'>
                            <h4 id= 'passiveVoice'>Passive voice</h4>
                            <p>
                                To tell if you’re using the passive voice, look out for:
                            </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>When the object comes before the subject (e.g. the item was purchased by the customer)</li>
                                <li>Past tense verbs (e.g. “was” added, “was” created, etc.)</li>
                                <li>Forms of the verb “to be” (e.g. was, is, were, etc.)</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>
                                You should almost always write in the active voice, but here’s when to use the passive voice:
                            </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>To avoid referring to yourself or COMET</li>
                                <li>To make it clear that you didn’t personally take an action or make a decision</li>
                                <li>If the object (thing being done) is more important than the subject (person doing the thing)</li>
                            </ul>
                        </div>

                                Contractions are abbreviated words. We use them to set a light and casual tone in the interface. The goal is to sound human, so avoid contracting verbs that sound awkward when you say them out loud, or have been phased out of modern day speech.
                            </p>
                        </div>

                            <p>
                                Use words and language that our users use. Avoid jargon or technical terminology. Make sure each sentence has a single focus and keep them short. Aim for a Grade 7 reading level.

                            <ul>

                                <li>Capitalize proper or trademarked nouns (e.g. names of products, countries, people)</li>
                                <li>Lowercase for everything else</li>

                                <p>
                                    In general, if a feature or product isn’t unique to COMET, don’t capitalize it (e.g. blogs, navigation, pages). If it’s unique to COMET and marketable as its own product, capitalize it (e.g. COMET Payments, Frenzy).
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    For all terms and definitions, check our full <a href= "../Vocubulary"> vocabulary list</a>.

                                    Job titles should be capitalized when they come before or after a person’s name (e.g. Content Strategist Jane Smith or Jane Smith, Content Strategist). When referring to a job title without referencing a name, don’t capitalize the job title (e.g. Jane Smith is a content strategist at COMET.)

                                    The first letter following a slash shouldn’t be capitalized.

                                The use of articles (the, a, an) in headings depends on whether the message is conversational or action-based microcopy.
                            </p>
                            <div class= 'subSection'>

                                <p>
                                    In more conversational sections of the interface, like Home cards, sell pages, and empty states, use articles. It makes the language more approachable and helps understanding when introducing new, complex concepts.
                                </p>
                            </div>

                                <p>
                                    In labels and microcopy, be concise and don’t use articles. It increases readability and encourages immediate action.
                                </p>

                                    Menu lists give users a horizontal set of actions when space is limited. The order of actions is often based on logic such as most popular actions.

                                    Actions in a menu follow a {verb}+{noun} pattern. If there’s enough context, only a verb might be required.
                                </p>

                                    Menu lists give users a horizontal set of nouns when space is limited. The order of nouns is often based on logic such as most recent orders.

                                    Nouns in a menu should be concise but still give the user enough information so they can easily find and accurately select the item they want.

                            These guidelines are for American English, which is the language we use as a base before translating to other languages. However, dates, numbers, and addresses may be formatted differently in other languages. You can use <a href= "https://github.com/COMET/quilt">helpers</a> to ensure they are localized automatically..

                                When possible, use the month’s full name, for example, October. If there are space constraints, use 3-letter abbreviations, for example, Oct. Don’t write dates numerically, for example, 07-02-14.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Don’t use ordinal indicators, which are words representing position or rank in a sequential order (e.g. 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th).

                                <li>Use the 12-hour clock, followed by am or pm.</li>
                                <li>Include a space after the last number, for example, “Your package will arrive at 12:35 pm”. Adding the space helps with formatting for English-speaking markets outside of North America, so we use it for North American usage as well.</li>
                                <li>Use the browser time of the logged in user.</li>
                                <li>If indicating a time zone is necessary, use the time zone’s abbreviation and write it after am or pm, for example, 4:00 pm NZDT.</li>
                                <li>To show a time range, use an en dash and include the am/pm after both times, for example, 3:00 pm–4:00 pm.</li>
                                <li>If indicating both the date and time, separate them with the word “at”, rather than with a comma.</li>

                                For all other languages, the time format will be automatically localized by the <code>Intl.DateTimeFormat</code> within JS.

                            <p>

                                When including currency with a price, the currency comes after the dollar amount.

                            <h4>Numbers</h4>
                            <p>
                                In general, use numerals. If the number is below 10 and not integral to the sentence, spell it out in full.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Use commas for numbers with four or more digits. Whenever possible, don’t truncate numbers:
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Use hyphens when writing phone numbers. Don’t use brackets, spaces, periods, or plus signs:
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Use an en dash without a space on either side for number ranges:
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Use “to” instead of an en dash if a number range is preceded by “from” in a phrase. Use “and” if a range is preceded by “between”.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                For undefined upward ranges, use “and up” or “or more”.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                For downward ranges, be specific.

                            <p>
                                For storage and memory sizes (e.g. kB, GB), the unit of measurement should be uppercase. Include a space between the number and unit of measurement.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                For dimensions and weights, the unit of measurement should be lowercase. Include a space between the number and unit of measurement.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                For dimensions and weights, use decimals instead of fractions:
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                When listing out dimensions in a row, put the unit of measurement at the end instead of after each number and include a space.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In all cases, include a space between the number and the unit.

                                Use the oxford comma (also known as the serial comma) in sentences. There should be a comma after every list item (unless you’re using a bulleted or numbered list).

                            <p>
                                The ellipses (…) can be used in place of a missing piece of text (most commonly to show the deletion of words from a direct quotation). Avoid using ellipses in text.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Use ellipses for:
                            </p>
                            <ul>

                            <p>
                                Don’t use ellipses for:
                            </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Placeholder copy</li>

                            </ul>
                            <p>
                                Always use the ellipsis character, not three periods.
                            </p>

                                <p>
                                    Consider constraints of the space in the interface when deciding to use truncation. Think about what part of the string users needs most. It’s usually the beginning or end, which means you might have to truncate the middle of the string.
                                </p>
                            </div>

                                <p>
                                    A button with an ellipsis icon (not the same as text) is used to expand more actions. It’s typically used in cards, or for horizontal sets of actions when space is limited. Android uses a vertical version (vertically stacked dots).
                                </p>

                            <p>
                                Use an en dash with no spaces in between (–) for a fixed range of numbers
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Use an em dash only if you can’t make your message clearer by splitting it into two sentences. Use an em dash without a space on either side (—).
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Depending on the font or appearance, you may want to include a hair space on either side of the en or em dash. HTML entity code for hair space is &hairsp; or &#8202;.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Tip: On Mac the keyboard shortcuts are option - for en dash and shift option - for em dash.

                                Avoid exclamation marks—only use them for really really exciting things. If you absolutely have to, limit yourself to one exclamation mark per page.

                                Use hyphens to:
                            </p>

                            <h4>Periods</h4>
                            <p>
                                Periods often end up in places they shouldn’t, and are omitted at strange times. In general, don’t use periods in interface copy unless it’s a full sentence description.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                When to use periods:
                            </p>
                        </div>

                            <p>
                                Avoid question marks wherever possible. Reword into affirmative statements wherever you can, but there are exceptions:
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                It’s okay to use question marks if you don’t know the result of the question:
                            </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>“Did you forget your password?”</li>
                                <li>“Do you need to add a shipping rate?”</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>
                                Don’t use question marks if:
                            </p>
                            <ul>

                            <p>
                                Use quotation marks to:
                            </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Define words (“growth-hacking”)</li>
                                <li>Quote text</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>
                                Place commas and periods inside quotation marks.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Always use smart (curly) quotes, not vertical (straight) quotes.

                                Avoid semicolons if possible. If you really need them, use semicolons to:

                                Use American spelling for all external-facing COMET content. When in doubt, check the <a href= "https://www.merriam-webster.com/">Merriam-Webster dictionary</a> for the preferred spelling of specific terms.

                                Tip: it’s easy to miss Canadian spelling. Switch your laptop language settings to American English and turn spell check on. It will highlight any Canadianisms you might have missed.
