# Personas for Cross-dock employee

 ## Personality (BIG FIVE):
  When you look up the meaning of the word personality, you may find something like ‘that what characterizes a person’. In everyday life we use terms such as character, identity or predisposition.

  Personality can be divided into different components and characteristics. Over time, many different classifications have been made in personality characteristics. Literally hundreds!

  Today, the majority of personality researchers support the Five Factor theory of personality, which describes five broad personality dimensions that compose human personality.   
  These are:
  1. Openness
  2. Conscientiousness
  3. Extraversion
  4. Agreeable
  5. Neuroticism

  ### Openness (higher is better)
   Indicates how open minded and authority challenging a person is.

  ### Conscientiousness (higher is better)
   Indicates how self disciplined and organized a person is.

  ### Extraversion (higher is better)
   Indicates how out going and social a person is.

  ### Agreeable (higher is better)
   Indicates how warm, friendly and tactful a person is.

  ### Neuroticism (less is better)
   Indicates a persons ability to remain stable and balanced.

  ### About:
   Danile is a self reliant person.

   Since Daniel tries to keep it to himself and does not prefer outside help, he usually ends up taking time to learn new things.   
   This sometimes leads to him not being able to use the equipment provided to him in an efficient manner.   
   Daniel takes his work lightly and isn't always focussed thus reprinting labels and repacking items usually takes place at his workstation more than expected.   
   Daniel like to have his own logic behind how things should be done and does not always follow procedures set by the supervisors.
